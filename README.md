Staying on budget has never been easier

  With the Grocery Tracker web app, you'll never get caught off guard at the cash register again. Put in your grocery list on the way to the store, then as you add each item to your cart, add the price. Bought more than one, or realized there was a better sale? Just edit the item! It's super easy to use and should help everyone stay on track.

PROJECT NOTES:
I wanted to use this project to get used to Git and Github. It's also my first full app made entirely of JavaScript. I know a little jQuery, but I wanted to impose a "no-library" limit on this app so that I would really get more of an understanding of the actual language. That being said, this was my first real attempt at Git so I'm sure my commits were terrible. They felt verbosely short or concisely useless most of the time. BUT, you gotta start somewhere, right?
