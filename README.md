Staying on budget has never been easier

  With the Grocery Tracker web app, you'll never get caught off guard at the cash register again. 
To use it, just put items in your grocery list before you go shopping. Once you're at the store, add each item to your cart with its
price. Bought more than one, or realized there was a better sale? Just edit the item! It's super easy to use and should help everyone
stay on track.

PROJECT GOALS:
  -Learn git on the command line and how to use GitHub
  -Build first app made entirely of JavaScript
  -Learn to use the Web Storage API -Incorporate user feedback into design process
I know a little jQuery, but I wanted to impose a "no-library" limit on this app so that I would really get more of an
understanding of the actual language.

PROJECT NOTES: Since I have accomplished all of my goals, I think this little program is finished for now. 
I think the code is in good shape; it's condensed as much as possible while still being readable. This was my first real attempt at
Git so I'm sure my commits were terrible. They felt verbosely short or concisely pointless most of the time, 
and I definitely made way, way too many. BUT, you gotta start somewhere, right?
